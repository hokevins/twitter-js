// David:  express.static is powerful b/c it allows you to not create routes for your files!  Request asks if the access need anything with /public, if so, here's all the files and I'll send it all.  Only works for STATIC, hence the name.  MOSTLY USED FOR IMAGES ONLY.

OMRI:  Friday 11:45am - TAKE OMRI'S NOTES
1-- Morgan vs. Express implementation as middleware, what are the differences?
  -- Why 301 redirects with Morgan but not express?
      301 redirects with Morgan is actually correct b/c the current express implementation is not doing res.on(waiting for a response back actually)
2-- why can't I next on the body parser b/c it'll hang?
    b/c there is no next(); instead, must redirect.

3-- if error, silent errors?  What is it, why? (look more into this)
4-- twitter.js pipe flow (I understand if I review it)
5-- High level overview of sql database image what's happening explain? (look at the diagram and explain it)
5.5-- reading test spec tips in mocha (just practice and experience)

6 -- Any additional feedback is welcomed! no feedback, very good, be careful not too aggressive in pairs with my outgoing personality, hypothetically.
